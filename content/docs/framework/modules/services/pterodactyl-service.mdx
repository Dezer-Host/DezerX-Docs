# Pterodactyl Setup

Follow this documentation to setup Pterodactyl with DezerX!

## Step 1: Edit Pterodactyl Configuration

1. **Open the Pterodactyl configuration file** by running the following command:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml
```

> **Note:** If you're using a different text editor (e.g., `vi` or `vim`), replace `nano` with your preferred editor.

2. **Scroll down** until you find the following line in the configuration file:

```yaml
allowed_origins: []
```

3. **Modify it** to include the allowed origins for your DezerX dashboard:

```yaml
allowed_origins:
  - https://dash.example.com
  - http://dash.example.com
```

> **Important:** Replace `https://dash.example.com` and `http://dash.example.com` with your actual dashboard URLs.

## Step 2: Restart Wings

After saving the configuration changes, you need to **restart the Wings service** to apply them. Run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wings
```

## Step 3: Configure DezerX Admin Panel

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel**: Go to `Admin → Modules → Pterodactyl Service`

   - Copy the generated key

   - Create a new client API key
   - Copy the generated key

4. **Configure in DezerX**:
   - Paste the Application API key in the designated field
   - Paste the Client API key in the designated field
   - Enter your Pterodactyl panel URL
   - Click the "Test Connection" button to verify the setup

## Testing Your Setup

Once you've configured both API keys and the panel URL:

1. Click the **"Test Connection"** button in the DezerX admin panel
2. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message
3. If there are any errors, double-check your API keys and panel URL

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Verify that your API keys have the correct permissions
- Ensure your Pterodactyl panel URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the `allowed_origins` configuration includes your DezerX dashboard URL
- Make sure the Wings service has been restarted after configuration changes
