## Creating the Database

DezerX Spartan requires a MariaDB/MySQL database to store its data. Follow these steps to create a dedicated database and user for your installation.

### 1. Access MySQL/MariaDB

First, log into your MySQL/MariaDB server as the root user:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

You'll be prompted to enter your root password that was set during the MariaDB installation.

### 2. Create Database User and Database

Execute the following SQL commands to create a dedicated user and database for DezerX Spartan:

```sql
# Remember to change 'yourPassword' below to be a unique, strong password
CREATE USER 'dezer'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourPassword';
CREATE DATABASE dezerx;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dezerx.* TO 'dezer'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

### 3. Database Configuration Details

Make note of these credentials as you'll need them during the DezerX Spartan setup:

- **Database Host:** `127.0.0.1`
- **Database Name:** `dezerx`
- **Database User:** `dezer`
- **Database Password:** `yourPassword` (the password you set above)
- **Database Port:** `3306` (default)
