# Setup SSL with Certbot

## Download Certbot Package

We'll start by downloading the `certbot` package which can be used to create SSL certificates for your website.

```bash
# If using NGINX run the following:
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# If using Apache run the following:
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-apache
```

## Creating a Certificate

Assuming you have set your domain to point to your webserver IP, you're ready to create a certificate. Creating an SSL cert is as simple as running one of the commands below:

```bash
# If you are using NGINX:
certbot certonly --nginx -d example.com

# If you are using Apache:
certbot certonly --apache -d example.com

# Use this if neither works. Make sure to stop your webserver first when using this method.
certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com
```

## Multiple Domains/Subdomains

You can secure multiple domains or subdomains in a single certificate:

```bash
certbot certonly --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com -d api.example.com
```

## Automatic Renewal

Certbot certificates expire every 90 days. Set up automatic renewal:

```bash
# Test renewal process
certbot renew --dry-run

# Add to crontab for automatic renewal
echo "0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet" | sudo crontab -
```

## Certificate Locations

Certificates are typically stored in:
- **Certificate**: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem`
- **Private key**: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem`

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your domain's DNS A record points to your server's IP
- Check that ports 80 and 443 are open in your firewall
- For the standalone method, stop your web server first: `systemctl stop nginx` or `systemctl stop apache2`
- If you get rate limit errors, Let's Encrypt has limits on certificate requests per domain

## Post-Installation

After creating certificates:
- For NGINX: Update your server block to use the generated certificate files
- For Apache: Update your virtual host configuration
- Test your SSL configuration at [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
